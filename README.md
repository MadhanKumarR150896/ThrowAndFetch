# Built this animation by taking a leaf out of my life .

  **I wanted to make something out of love for my dog(#Milo - Added his photo in the tab icon) , so created a scene where a human throws a ball and the dog moves to fetch the ball and return it to the human. **

Have used **keyframes** to produce the animations and used time delay to create a **15 second scene with sequential flow** .
Used **DOM** to get the ball and sun.
Used **Event Listeners** to trigger the action through **click** and also by **keydown**.
